 Named your CSS framework
 Made a Repo
 Copied Sample files into Repo
 Choose a font
It's probably best to use a system font. See the notes in lesson 4.
The big decision here is choose between a serif or sans-serif font family.
 Set a default font style on thhe body element.
Define your default font style by styling the body tag.
Set the font-family
Set the font-size
Set the line-height
Set the fore ground color
Set the background color
 Set a style for the headings h1-6
 Set the sizes of each of these.
 Set other styles to get a look that you like. Consider these:
margin-top and margin-bottom
color
font-weight
letter-spacing
 Style other text elements
 strong
 em
 a
 abbr
 code (this might use a different font - probably a fixed width font)
You may not specifically define styles for everyone of the elements above, but you should consider the styles for each of these.
